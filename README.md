This class for LaTeX allows you to create scripts for your movie / play / radio drama - according to the recommendations by the BBC / Oscar / and other wellknown institutions.

For TeX there is already http://ctan.unsw.edu.au/help/Catalogue/entries/screenplay.html but 'screenplayer' shall become the Swiss army for scripts (know more different formats than 'screenplay').

It is not ready for production yet. But feel free to fork and work on it .)
